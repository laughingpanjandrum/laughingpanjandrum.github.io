<p>Nuns at the isolated church used to come into town once per week, trading embroidery for goods. They haven't been seen in months. Merchants say that the gardens are overgrown and that the sisters are sickly. More recent visitors have failed to return.</p>

		<p><h3>Approach</h3>
		Overturned merchant's cart near the gates, choked with vines, skeletal remains mixed among the flowers. Bags of seeds have sprouted, barrels of cider left untouched.</p>
		
		<p><h3>1 Entrance</h3>
		Main doors always partly open. Thick red carpet with woven gold-leaf images of intertwining flowers. <b>Statues</b> of saintly figures. Vines grow through cracks in the floor, twining around the statues, they are heavy with white flowers. Scent of the flowers is strong and faintly intoxicating.<br>
		<b>If more than 10 minutes are spent here</b> save or fall asleep.
		</p>

		<p><h3>2 Chapel</h3>
		<b>Midnight to 2AM,</b> all 21 of the nuns are in the pews in worshipful poses. The <i>Ailing Flower Demon</i> walks among them, caressing their heads, & then, intimately, breathes spores into their mouths. They pay little attention. Disturbances will be put down as violently and swiftly as possible so that the ritual can be resumed.<br>
		<b>Afternoon,</b> d4 nuns are here praying.
		</p>

		<p><h3>3 Halls</h3>
		<b>Afternoon,</b> d4-1 nuns walking in the hall, speaking in low voices.
		</p>

		<p><h3>4 Rooms</h3>
		2 beds each. <b>From early morning to noon</b> the nuns will be sleeping in here. <br>
		<b>Outer rooms</b> have windows facing outward. <br>
		<ol><b>Items in a particular room -</b>
			<li>d20 silver pieces in a small pouch
			<li>Clean black habit
			<li>Wooden holy symbol wrapped in black cloth
			<li>Packet of candles
			<li>Mouldering scraps of bread
			<li>Packet of seeds
		</ol>
		</p>

		<p><h3>5 Overgrown Room</h3>
		Southern window is broken & thick vines grow through, filling the room with white flowers showering the room in pollen. <br>
		<b>If more than 10 minutes are spent here</b> save or fall asleep.
		</p>

		<p><h3>6 Mother Superior's Room</h3>
		<b>Morning to noon,</b> the Mother Superior will be sleeping here.<br>
		<b>Only one key</b> which she carries in her habit at all times.<br>
		<br>Filled with flowerpots, but the plants have grown out of their vessels & the room is now thick with dark flowers. <b>Buried in the plants</b> at the northern edge of the room is a small stone statue of a wilted flower - this is the <i>Icon of the Ailing Flower</i>. <br>
		<b><i>Icon of the Ailing Flower.</i></b> On sight, save or feel an immense urge to possess it, due to a percieved sense of unearthly beauty. Owner is compelled to nurture & collect plants, never to trim them. The white-flower vines will begin to flourish in their presence. The Ailing Flower Demon will arrive within 2d6 + 4 days. <br>
		<b>If more than 10 minutes are spent here</b> save or fall asleep.
		</p>

		<p><h3>7 Refectory</h3>
		Slightly dusty. The sisters do not eat anymore.
		</p>

		<p><h3>8 North Hall</h3>
		<b>Afternoon,</b> 25% chance that 1-2 nuns are passing by, their eyes downcast.
		</p>

		<p><h3>9 Kitchens</h3>
		Completely overgrown with white flowers & vines, the <b>east door</b> is open & the carpet of flowers spill out to overtake the garden. <b>Afternoon,</b> the Mother Superior will be here, lying amidst the plants and whispering to herself in the language of the Abyss. <br>
		<b>If more than 10 minutes are spent here</b> save or fall asleep.
		</p>

		<p><h3>10 Lair of the Ailing Flower Demon</h3>
		<br>Doors are locked.</b> The Mother Superior has the only key.<br>
		Broken crates of potatoes & spilled barrels of wine - signs this was once a storehouse. Pool of still water, 5' deep, laden with lilies. By day the Ailing Flower Demon sleeps here beneath the lilies. <b>By night</b> it pollinates the sisters from midnight to 2AM.
		</p>

		<p><h3>11 Exterior</h3>
		Crops have spoiled, garden is full of weeds, garden-shed is dusty and equipment has begun to rust. <br>
		<b>By night</b> after 2AM, the Ailing Flower Demon stands out here watching the moon, flowers growing and then wilting beneath its feet.
