<hr>

<p>
Long ago King Oraine met a bad end. His tomb has stood, untouched, in the jungle, for many years. <br>
The tomb is carved from white marble. The exterior is overgrown. The ceiling is cracked, admitting sunlight. Creeping vines have invaded.

		<p><h3>1 Entrance</h3>
			Tomb door is shut but unlocked, overgrown with vines. Hall also overgrown with lichen and flowers. Sunlight shines through cracks in the ceiling.
		</p>
		
		<p><h3>2 Pool and Statues</h3>
			Statues of 4 women, each bearing a marble pitcher. Greenery spills from the pitchers. <b>Pool</b> is 5' deep, layer of lichen grows over it. 3 rotten corpses lie under the surface, wearing remnants of tomb-robbing gear.<br>
			<b>The door to room 6</b> is locked.
		</p>
		
		<p><h3>3 Statues & Brazier</h3>
			Marble statues of faceless knights. <b>Fire</b> burns in the brazier - it has been lit recently.
		</p>
		
		<p><h3>4 Procession of Glass</h3>
			Procession of extraordinarly lifelike figures, each carved from a solid piece of blue glass. They appear to be noblemen and women making their way towards <b>room 8</b>. (In fact, during King Oraine's funeral procession, the guests were frozen eternally in glass by the Splintered Daughter.)<br>
			The statues are sturdy, but frequent solid blows will shatter them. Each statue corresponds to one of the 8 <b>Glass Spectres</b> in room 12 - the spirit is obliterated on the destruction of its statue.<br>
			One of the statues has its hand on the door to <b>room 8</b> - can't be opened so long as the statue holds it in place.
		</p>
		
		<p><h3>5 Consumed Tomb-Robber</h3>
			His arms and legs bizarrely long, he stoops, his head brushing the ceiling. His hands are clawed talons. His clothes hang in tatters. His flesh is pale & necrotic, glass shards protrude. Too big to leave the room, berserk with rage.<br>
			Fused to his flesh, the <b>Glass Amulet</b>, cause of this horrific transformation. Made from a shard of the Frozen Emissary's skin.<br>
			Door to 7 is barricaded from the other side.
		</p>
			<p><b>HD</b> 3 <br>
			<b>ATK</b> claw d8 (10' reach), bite d6 <br>
			<b>DEF</b> leather <br>
			<b>Glass Shards</b> Attacks inflict bleeding
		</p>
		
		<p><h3>6 Creeping Things</h3>
			Four human-esque creatures, but they lope on all fours, their flesh mangled and rotted. Remains of several half-eaten victims litter the floor. They hunger for human flesh. <br>
			Fat <i>purple fruits</i> hang from vines on the ceiling. They are nourishing & delicious, but a steady diet of them leads to the transformation seen here.<br>
			<b>Secret door</b> buried behind vines leads north. Door to 7 is barricaded from the other side.<br> Door to room 2 is locked.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>HD</b> 3 <br>
			<b>ATK</b> claw d6 <br>
			<b>DEF</b> leather <br>
			<b>Hunger</b> On a successful kill, they begin to ravenously devour the victim, ignoring all else.
		</p>
		
		<p><h3>7 Surviving Tomb-Robbers</h3>
			Three tomb-robbers huddled together. They have barricaded the doors to rooms 5 & 6. They fled here after one of their members was transformed into the horrible thing in room 5, and survived from some time on the purple fruits, leading to the creation of the creeping things in room 6. They are desperate and half-mad. Another day or two of eating purple fruits will cause them to transform, too.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Voris, Vedrik, and Veritas</b><br>
			<b>HD</b> 3 <br>
			<b>ATK</b> sword (d8) <br>
			<b>DEF</b> leather and buckler <br>
		</p>
		
		<p><h3>8 Amarek the Half-Man</h3>
			He was only half-transformed into glass. Half flesh, exposed organs trapped between shards of glass. Unable to die or speak. In one hundred years, he has managed to creep nearly to the end of the hall, leaving a streak of dried blood on the white marble floor. In another twenty he might reach the door.
		</p>
		
		<p><h3>9 Statues</h3>
			Marble statues of faceless knights. <b>Fire</b> burns in the brazier - it has been lit recently.<br>
		</p>
		
		<p><h3>10 Ruined Construct</h3>
			Immense clockwork knight lies in a tangle of vines. They've grown through its innards. It animates if anyone disturbs the overgrowth. Its <i>heart</i> could be used to animate the broken clockworks in room 13.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>HD</b> 10 <br>
			<b>ATK</b> slam 2d6 <br>
			<b>DEF</b> as plate, construct immunities <br>
			<b>Ruined</b> 25% chance to miss turn, sound of grinding gears
			<b>Clockwork Heart</b> Tightly-meshed orb of brass gears, enchanted; grants life to clockwork constructs
		</p>

		<p><h3>11 Graves of Faithful Knights</h3>
			Each stone coffin is carved in the shape of a faithful knight. Within lies their armour & their dusty bones. Shards of glass sprout from their bones & split the armour. Noisily disturbing the coffins will rouse the Glass Spectres in room 12.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Search the coffins:</b>
			<ol>
				<li>Silver ring worth 25 sp
				<li>Ceremonial sword, mysteriously un-rusted
				<li>Enchanted dagger
				<li>Silver holy symbol from a forgotten religion
			</ol>
		</p>
		
		<p><h3>12 Graves of Faithful Servants & the Glass Spectres</h3>
			Ghostly noblemen & women, appear to be refracted through panes of glass. Crystalline visages frozen in expressions of agony and rage.<br>
			Each of the stone coffins is carved in the shape of a faithful servant.
		</p>
		<p><b>Glass Spectre</b><br>
			<b>HD</b> 5 <br>
			<b>ATK</b> touch causes shard of glass to embed itself in the victim (d6 damage) <br>

			</ol>
		</p>
		
		</p><h3>13 Clockwork Servants</h3>
			Three clockwork servants trapped amidst tangled vines. None have hearts. If animated, they will follow faithfully, unlock any locked doors (including to room 18), & assist with simple tasks as directed. They are incapable of committing violence. <br>
			
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>HD</b> 1 <br>
			<b>DEF</b> as plate, construct immunities
		</p>
		
		<p><h3>14 Graves of Faithful Servants, the Splintered Daughter</h3>
			She staggers among the coffins, impaled on thousands of slim and razor-sharp glass spines. Her eyes are pale crystal orbs. She is an old spirit, long ago wronged by King Oraine - imprisoned as long as he lived, his death released her, too late for revenge, so she had her revenge on the funereal procession. Now, wracked by rage, guilt, & agony, she haunts his tomb forever.<br>
			<b>If a fight starts,</b> she will cry out in rage, & the corpses of the 26 faithful servants will rise from their coffins, covered in spines of glass, to aid her.<br>
			<b>The door to room 15</b> is locked. There is a gap in the marble wall above the door, just wide enough to admit a monkey.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>The Splintered Daughter</b><br>
			<b>HD</b> 12 <br>
			<b>ATK</b> glass spike d8 <br>
			<b>DEF</b> as plate; anyone attacking her in melee takes d6 damage from the spines <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Faithful Servants</b><br>
			<b>HD</b> 1<br>
			<b>ATK</b> glass slash d4 <br>
		</p>
		
		<p><h3>15 Flooded Chamber</h3>
			The floor is sunken, broken, and filthy water has flooded in from underground. 4' deep, slow to move through. The walls are covered with vines. Mad Monkeys are fond of fleeing through here, as they can clamber along the vines while their victims struggle through the water.<br>
			<b>The door to room 14</b> is locked. There is a gap in the marble wall above the door, just wide enough to admit a monkey.
		</p>
		
		<p><h3>16 Chamber of Glass</h3>
			Sharp spines of glass stick up through the floor. Unless you're wearing metal boots, moving through here causes your feet to bleed, hobbling you until you're healed (move at 1/2 speed).
		</p>
		
		<p><h3>17 Lair of the Mad Monkeys</h3>
			The purple fruits grow here in abundance, & the Mad Monkeys are immune to their deleterious effects. <a href="#monkey">3d6 Mad Monkeys</a> here at any given time, bloated and sleepy. They will try to defend their territory. <br>
			Three <i>clockwork hearts</i> are here, smashed to pieces by the monkeys.<br>
			The <b>northern door</b> is reinforced with iron & decorated with bands of gold. Locked with an enchanted lock. The <i>clockwork servants</i> in <b>room 13</b>, & the Grave-Keeper, know the trick to opening it. Breaking it off will be noisy & time-consuming. It can't be picked except via magic.
		</p>
		
		<p><h3>18 Grave of King Oraine</h3>
			He lies in an immense tomb of marble, decorated with icons & carvings of gold.<br>
			The <a href="#grave_keeper">clockwork grave-keeper</a> will be here if it's still alive & will try to stop interlopers from disturbing the tomb.<br>
			<b>The coffin itself</b> is worth 10,000 sp intact, but will be exceedingly difficult to remove. In pieces it is worth 1,000 sp. <br>
			<b>Within the coffin</b> lie Oraine's elaborate crown (2,500 sp), his grave-wrappings of silk (enchanted to never rot, 2,000 sp), & his heavy sceptre of iron and gold (1,200 sp).
